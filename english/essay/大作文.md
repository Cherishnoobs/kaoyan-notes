Love

As is vividly shown in the picture, a candle is lit up in a bowl on the ground. Different from any other candle we commonly see, the spark of this one is like a smiling face, indicating love and happiness. The caption above the candle reads, "Love is a light, the darker it faces, the brighter it shines".

What the picture tries to convey to us is that, no matter how tough the hardship is, it would be possible for us to overcome it so long as we hold a belief of love. Take the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 for example, enormously disastrous as it was, the once-in-a-century earthquake destroyed tens of thousands of buildings, roads, public facilities, and, most regretfully, homes. While the disaster was strong, the love of people from all around the country and even the world was stronger. Thanks to the donations, medical aids, material supplies, and more importantly, the belief and love of themselves, the local people finally recovered from the earthquake and returned to normal life.

To me, love is not only an abstract concept we are always talking about, but also something that we must take into action. Donating old clothes, helping senior citizens across the road, and so on - these are all the little things that can generate great help. The key is whether we do them or not.

Cultures - National and International

As is shown above, in the center of the picture stands a lovely American girl, smiling. If we dig into the details, we will find that the most special part is that she is wearing a traditional Chinese costume, which indicates the trend of international cultural exchange nowadays.

In the modern world, with the rise of the Internet, people from all around the world are connected closer than it was a dozen years ago. Since we can now chat with an American or a European without almost any latency, cultural exchange has been profoundly enhanced. Besides what the photo above shows, there are many other similar cases of this phenomenon, for instance, traditional programs of Malaysia are being performed in China, and Chinese orchestras are playing songs originate from ancient Britain.

In my view, on the one hand, it should be encouraged that people from different countries share their cultural heritage with each other, making the national international. On the other hand, while facing alien cultures, it's important for us to determine whether they are positive or negative, and take in the good ones and dismiss the bad ones.
